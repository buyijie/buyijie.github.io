Recently, Baidu release the codes of some infrastructures on Github(https://github.com/baidu) 
Exciting! These infrastructures currently include:

* tera - A sturctured distributed database.
* bfs (aka, The Baidu File System) - A distributed file system designed to support 
real-time applications.
* Paddle (aka, PArallel Distributed Deep LEarning) - An easy-to-use, efficient, 
flexible and scalable deep learning platform.
* galaxy - A cluster management system.
* sofa-pbrpc - A light-weight RPC implement of google protobuf RPC framework.
* shuttle - A fast Map-Reduce computing framework based on Galaxy.

I think the following projects are new-contributor friendly:

* tera - This projects have 5 tasks to help new contributor start
* bfs
* Paddle - It has a contribution guide.
