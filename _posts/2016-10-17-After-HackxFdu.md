In this hackathon, my team built a content search service named GithubEye to 
help people find Github repos. You can try our demo on this web address 
<http://githubeye.mybluemix.net>

Here I give two scenarios when you may need this search service: 

1. You are following a lot of people and you want to find some interesting repos
from these people. But you don't want to spend the whole afternoon to browse
all these repos one by one. Fine, just use our service. Type your Github user name 
and your natural language description of what you are looking for. Then, our service 
return you the sorted repo list, according to the similarity to your description.

2. You want to find some high qualified repos in some area. Although you are newbie
in this area, you know some person who is famous in this area. Here you go! Type 
the Github user name of this famous person and your natural language description of 
what you are looking for. Then our service return you the sorted repo list from that 
famous person's following list.
